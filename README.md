## Secure Data Hiding Using Image Steganography

## Project Overview

This project implements image steganography using Python, allowing users to securely hide and retrieve messages within images. The messages are protected with password authentication, ensuring data confidentiality.

## Features

Data Hiding: Encrypts messages into image pixels.

Password Protection: Only authorized users can decrypt the hidden message.

User-Friendly GUI: Simple interface for encryption and decryption.

Multiple Image Formats: Supports JPG, PNG, and BMP.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, Tkinter, NumPy

GUI Framework: Tkinter

## Use Cases

Secure message transmission

Protecting confidential information

Digital watermarking

Cybersecurity applications

Installation & Usage

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy tkinter

## Run the script:

steganography.py

## Future Enhancements

Improved encryption algorithms for enhanced security

Support for additional file types (e.g., audio, video)

Mobile and web-based implementation

Cloud integration for secure storage
